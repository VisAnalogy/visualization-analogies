      Imagine you are standing at the center of a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">circular graduation hall</span>, where 
      every ring of seating represents a level in a university’s hierarchy. 
      This arrangement mirrors a <span class="analogy-highlight">Sunburst Plot</span> 
      that displays how <span class="analogy-highlight">graduates</span> are 
      distributed across faculties, departments, and majors, all radiating 
      outward from the central <span class="analogy-highlight">University Administration</span>.
    </p>
  
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">First Ring: Faculties</h3>
    <p>
      Circling the stage is the 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">ring of Faculties</span>—Science, 
      Business, and Arts. Think of these as sections of seating dedicated to 
      each broad discipline. Each faculty segment provides a higher-level 
      category, organizing its various departments. This setup mirrors how 
      faculties serve as an intermediate hierarchy between the university core 
      and its <span class="analogy-highlight">departments</span>.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Second Ring: Departments</h3>
    <p>
      The next layer outward holds the 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">department seats</span>, subdividing each 
      faculty into specialized areas such as 
      <strong>Biological Sciences</strong>, <strong>Physical Sciences</strong>, 
      <strong>Mathematics &amp; Computer Science</strong> (under Science), 
      <strong>Administration</strong>, <strong>Finance &amp; Accounting</strong> 
      (under Business), and 
      <strong>Fine Arts</strong>, <strong>Performing Arts</strong> (under Arts).
      Each department has its own “section” in the ring, offering a closer look 
      at how each faculty is broken down.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Third Ring (Outermost): Majors (Graduates)</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, at the outermost ring, you see 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">individual majors</span> with their counts 
      of graduates. This is where the <span class="analogy-highlight">Sunburst</span> 
      truly shines, as each major’s “slice” shows the 
      <strong>number of graduates</strong> at a glance. Visualize the seats filled 
      by graduates from <strong>Commerce</strong> or <strong>Literature</strong>, 
      who appear directly in the third ring if they are not tied to a distinct 
      department. This ensures every graduate’s place is clearly visible, 
      illustrating how each major contributes to the overall academic community.
