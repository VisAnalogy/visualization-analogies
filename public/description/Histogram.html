      Imagine a <span class="analogy-highlight">teacher</span> standing at the front of the 
      classroom, distributing <span class="analogy-highlight">worksheet booklets</span> to 
      students. Each stack of booklets represents a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">score range</span>, showing how many students 
      scored within that bracket. This visual representation of stacked booklets 
      is akin to a <span class="analogy-highlight">Histogram</span>.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Stacking Up the Scores</h3>
    <p>
      In a Histogram, each bar corresponds to a range of values (like a grade range),
      and its <strong>height</strong> or <strong>size</strong> indicates how many
      items (students) fall into that range. Here, each 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">stack of booklets</span> is a bar, showing 
      you at a glance which ranges have the most or fewest scores.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Sorting the Class</h3>
    <p>
      Picture the teacher flipping through every test, placing each one in the 
      appropriate stack based on its score. By the end, each score range has a 
      “pile” of tests that reveal its <span class="analogy-highlight">frequency</span>.
      In other words, the taller the pile, the more students scored in that bracket.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Identifying Trends</h3>
    <p>
      When you see these stacked booklets (bars) lined up, you can easily spot 
      which score ranges are most common. This is exactly how a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Histogram</span> works in data analysis: 
      it helps you identify patterns or concentrations of values across 
      various ranges with just one glance.
