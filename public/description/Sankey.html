      Imagine you have a <span class="analogy-highlight">network of highways</span>
      connecting a series of towns—each town is a hub of activity. 
      A <span class="analogy-highlight">Sankey Diagram</span> shows you not just 
      the routes from one town to another but also the 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">flow of car traffic</span> along each path, 
      depicted by the thickness of the “highways.”
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Cities as Nodes</h3>
    <p>
      In a Sankey Diagram, each <strong>city</strong> becomes a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">node</span>. Think of it like looking at a 
      regional map from above, where every town stands out as a significant circle 
      or rectangle—your main stops on the journey. The bigger or more prominent 
      the node, the more traffic might be flowing in or out of that particular city.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Highway Lanes as Flows</h3>
    <p>
      Each highway connecting two towns is a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">flow</span> in the Sankey Diagram. The 
      thickness or width of the highway illustrates how many cars travel along 
      that route. A wide road signals <strong>heavy traffic</strong>, while a 
      narrow one means <strong>lighter traffic</strong>. This visual cue helps you 
      grasp at a glance which routes are most congested and which are less traveled.

    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Visualizing Congestion Hotspots</h3>
    <p>
      By seeing these <strong>thick and thin</strong> flows, you quickly spot 
      which highways are busiest, much like noticing traffic jams on an actual 
      road map. Maybe Charleston to Alton is a superhighway jammed with cars, 
      whereas Benton to Denton is a calmer, scenic drive. 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Sankey Diagrams</span> help city planners 
      (and curious onlookers) figure out where to focus efforts—like widening 
      roads, adding tolls, or directing drivers to alternate routes.
