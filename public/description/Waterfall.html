      Imagine you are flipping through a photo album of 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Mario's journey</span>, where each picture
      captures a moment when he <span class="analogy-highlight">gains</span> or 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">loses</span> height. 
      A <span class="analogy-highlight">Waterfall Chart</span> shows Mario’s 
      progress step by step, illustrating how each 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">platform</span> move contributes to his
      ascent toward the <strong>top of a mountain</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Mario’s Photo Album</h3>
    <p>
      For each stage of Mario’s climb, 
      revealing whether he lands on a platform that boosts him higher 
      (<strong>positive height</strong>) or causes him to fall 
      (<strong>negative height</strong>).
      Think of it like snapshots in time, where you can see his altitude 
      change at every turn.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Gains and Losses</h3>
    <p>
      In the <span class="analogy-highlight">Waterfall Chart</span>, each bar
      appears one after another, similar to flipping a page in the album.
      An upward bar symbolizes a power-up or successful jump 
      (<strong>gain in height</strong>), while a downward bar represents a slip
      or an enemy encounter (<strong>loss in height</strong>).
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Reaching the Summit</h3>
    <p>
      By the end of this photo album, you see Mario standing triumphant
      on the highest platform, reflecting how each of his 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">positive</span> and 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">negative</span> stages add up.
      The final bar in a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Waterfall Chart</span> displays the net 
      total, revealing the ultimate height Mario gains after all the ups 
      and downs of his adventure.
