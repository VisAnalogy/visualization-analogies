      Imagine you are looking at a city from above at night, and you see various
      neighborhoods illuminated by different amounts of light. The
      <span class="analogy-highlight">brightness</span> and 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">size</span> of each illuminated area represent the
      amount of activity or population density in that neighborhood.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">City Neighborhoods</h3>
    <p>
      Each neighborhood in the city represents a large rectangle in the treemap.
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul class="analogy-list">
      <li>Downtown</li>
      <li>Residential Area</li>
      <li>Commercial District</li>
      <li>Industrial Zone</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      A <span class="analogy-highlight">larger rectangle</span> indicates a bigger neighborhood
      or area with a higher overall population.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Light Intensity</h3>
    <p>
      The size and brightness of each illuminated area represent the population density
      or activity level. A <strong>brighter</strong> and larger area indicates a densely
      populated or highly active neighborhood.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Sub-neighborhoods</h3>
    <p>
      Within each large illuminated area (neighborhood), there are smaller areas
      representing sub-neighborhoods or specific blocks. For instance, within the
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Downtown</span> area, there are smaller bright spots for
      specific busy streets or popular spots.
