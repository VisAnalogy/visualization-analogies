      Imagine a series of <span class="analogy-highlight">screws</span> driven into 
      a wooden plank. Some of them are screwed in more deeply on one side, while 
      others protrude on the opposite side. This left-and-right arrangement around 
      the plank resembles a <span class="analogy-highlight">Butterfly Chart</span>, 
      with bars (screws) extending in two directions from the central axis 
      (the plank itself).
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Two Sides of the Plank</h3>
    <p>
      In a <span class="analogy-highlight">Butterfly Chart</span>, each bar can stretch 
      left to represent one category or group (for instance, <strong>negative 
      values</strong> or <strong>Category A</strong>) and to the right to represent 
      the opposing category (<strong>positive values</strong> or 
      <strong>Category B</strong>). Think of the wooden plank as the 
      <strong>zero line</strong>. Screws driven in on the left side show 
      “negative” values, while those sticking out on the right show 
      “positive” values.
    </p>
    
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Unified Center</h3>
    <p>
      The wooden plank in the middle is the shared reference point. In a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Butterfly Chart</span>, that “center line” 
      serves the same purpose: to anchor the bars (screws) that branch out in 
      opposite directions. Thanks to this symmetrical structure, you can easily 
      measure how far each data point extends in either direction, much like 
      noticing how one screw might be twisted far into the wood while the next 
      barely penetrates at all.
