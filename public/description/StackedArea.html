      Imagine gazing at a <span class="analogy-highlight">cross-section of the Earth’s soil</span> 
      over several decades, where each layer represents a different component:
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Organic layer</span>, 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Topsoil</span>, 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Eluviation layer</span>, 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Subsoil</span>, 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Parent Rock</span>, and 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Bedrock</span>. In a
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Stacked Area Chart</span>, these layers are 
      piled one atop the other to illustrate how the soil composition and thickness 
      evolve <strong>over time</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Layered Evolution</h3>
    <p>
      Each “slice” in time is like a vertical cut through the ground. As you move 
      from one decade to the next, you see changes in the <span class="analogy-highlight">thickness</span> 
      and <span class="analogy-highlight">depth</span> of each layer. The overall 
      shape shows how they stack up together, just like how a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Stacked Area Chart</span> displays cumulative 
      changes across different categories.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Decade by Decade</h3>
    <p>
      Each decade reveals a new cross-section, showing how the 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Organic layer</span> might become richer or 
      how the <span class="analogy-highlight">Topsoil</span> shifts over time. 
      This mirrors how a <strong>Stacked Area Chart</strong> extends along the 
      <strong>x-axis</strong> to portray trends over chronological intervals.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Total Depth</h3>
    <p>
      If you look at the combined height of all layers at each time point, you’ll 
      notice how it may rise or fall as conditions change. In a 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Stacked Area Chart</span>, the sum of all 
      stacked regions shows the total, while each individual region reveals 
      its contribution to that total—just like each soil layer’s contribution 
      to the ground’s overall depth.
