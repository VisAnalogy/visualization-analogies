      Imagine walking into a <span class="analogy-highlight">supermarket storage area</span>, 
      where each section is stocked with a specific type of goods—like 
      <strong>Produce</strong>, <strong>Dairy</strong>, or <strong>Bakery</strong>. 
      In a <span class="analogy-highlight">Heatmap</span>, every section of this 
      storage grid is color-coded to show how "hot" or "cold" it is—much like 
      temperature zones in a vast storage facility.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Rows, Columns, and Product Categories</h3>
    <p>
      Picture the storage floor divided into <strong>rows</strong> and 
      <strong>columns</strong>, each cell holding a different category: 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Frozen Food</span> might be 
      <strong>cool blue</strong>, while <span class="analogy-highlight">Machinery</span> 
      could be <strong>warm red</strong>. These colors represent how each category 
      compares to others in terms of a certain <strong>measurement</strong>—it could 
      be temperature, sales volume, or anything else the heatmap aims to highlight.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Temperature Gauge</h3>
    <p>
      In a <span class="analogy-highlight">Heatmap</span>, the colors range from 
      one extreme to another. Imagine a giant <strong>thermometer</strong> by the 
      warehouse door. As you move from the bottom (cold blues) to the top (hot reds),
      you can gauge how intense or significant a value is. For instance, 
      <strong>darker red squares</strong> might indicate high demand or 
      high temperature, whereas <strong>lighter blues</strong> signal lower demand 
      or cooler conditions.
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="analogy-subtitle">Spot the Extremes</h3>
    <p>
      If you glance across the grid, the colors let you instantly identify which 
      areas are “heating up” or “cooling down.” Perhaps 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Beverages</span> is glowing red-hot, 
      indicating a spike in sales or production, while 
      <span class="analogy-highlight">Cleaning Supplies</span> is in a calm blue, 
      suggesting a stable or lower volume. This quick visual cue is one of the 
      main advantages of a <span class="analogy-highlight">Heatmap</span>.
